# x-research

Sometimes the thing you're looking for is on Twitter, not Google.

New library just dropped? Devs are posting first impressions on X hours before blog posts exist. API broken? Someone already tweeted the workaround. Cultural moment happening? X has the raw takes while Google has SEO spam from three days later.

This is a skill for [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/claude-code) and [OpenClaw](https://github.com/claw-project/openclaw) that gives your agent the ability to search X — modeled after how Claude Code's built-in research agent works for web search. It decomposes your question into multiple search queries, iterates, follows threads, reads linked content, and comes back with a sourced briefing.

## How it works

You ask something like:

> "what are devs saying about the new X API pay-per-use pricing?"

The skill runs an agentic loop:
1. Breaks your question into 3-5 targeted queries from different angles (core topic, expert voices, pain points, linked resources)
2. Searches X via the API, surfaces the highest-signal tweets
3. Follows interesting threads for full context
4. Reads linked GitHub repos, blog posts, docs — not just the tweets
5. Synthesizes everything by theme with tweet links as sources
6. Saves to a markdown file so you can reference it later

## Example

Query: *"What are the best new OpenClaw skills?"*

6 search queries, ~150 tweets scanned, 4 GitHub repos deep-dived. Output:

```
### Circle Wallet (304 likes, 140K impressions)
Agent-controlled USDC wallets. Already in use at Moltbook hackathon.

- Deep dive: prompt injection detection, command validation, SSRF blocking,
  secret scanning. YAML config, SQLite analytics.
```

25+ skills surfaced with links. Total X API cost: ~$0.75 (with dedup across queries).

## Setup

1. Get an X API bearer token at [developer.x.com](https://developer.x.com) (pay-per-use tier works — ~$0.005/post returned)
2. Set the env var:
   ```bash
   export X_BEARER_TOKEN="your_token"
   ```

## Install — Claude Code

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills/x-research/references
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohunvora/x-research-skill/main/SKILL.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/x-research/SKILL.md
curl -sL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rohunvora/x-research-skill/main/references/x-api.md \
  -o ~/.claude/skills/x-research/references/x-api.md
```

## Install — OpenClaw

Tell your agent:

> Install a new skill called "x-research" from https://github.com/rohunvora/x-research-skill — read the SKILL.md and references/x-api.md and set them up. Make sure X_BEARER_TOKEN is in the environment.

## Usage

Just talk to it:

- "search x for what devs think about Bun 2.0"
- "what are people saying about the Vercel outage?"
- "x research: reactions to the new OpenAI model"
- "check twitter for Claude Code tips"

## Cost

X API pay-per-use charges per post returned (not per API request). At $0.005/post, a search returning 100 tweets costs $0.50. Same post returned across multiple queries in one day only counts once (dedup).

| Session | Queries | Unique Posts | Est. Cost |
|---------|---------|-------------|-----------|
| Quick check | 2-3 | ~100 | ~$0.50 |
| Standard | 4-6 | ~300 | ~$1.50 |
| Deep dive | 8-10 | ~600 | ~$3.00 |

Deep-diving linked URLs (GitHub, blogs, docs) is free. Exact per-endpoint rates are in the [Developer Console](https://console.x.com).

## Limitations

- **7-day window** — recent search only. Full archive needs the $5K/mo Pro tier.
- **Keyword search only** — no semantic/meaning-based search. The skill compensates by running multiple queries from different angles.
- **No `min_likes` filter** — engagement filtering happens after results come back, not at query time.
